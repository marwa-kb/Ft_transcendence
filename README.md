# ft_transcendence

### In this 42 project, we had to create a whole website. In a group of 5 people, we used NestJS as backend, ReactJS as frontend, and PostgreSQL as database.
> Thanks to your website, users will play Pong with others. You will provide a nice user interface, a chat, and real-time multiplayer online games!

#### For this project, I was in charge of the frontend so I had to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript and ReactJS.
